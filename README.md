4.	Scope and Background of Research:
	(Please identify key issues/problems to be addressed)
Financial sentiment analysis (FSA), as the term implies, is the application of sentiment analysis (SA )in the finance sector (维基百科，或找一篇综述). Likewise, FSA leverages knowledge and methods in NLP and computational linguistics to identify and extract opinions from text data. 加参考文献 However, it is deemed to be more challenging than other tasks within the field, such as SA for general purpose or of business reviews, in that it lacks (可能要修改) large-scale and high-quality (well-annotated) data for training, which is one of the reasons that FSA models usually get unsatisfactory performance. 第一篇综述2021和2018的论文
 
Technically, FSA is a fine-grained SA task – aspect-based sentiment analysis (AbSA), which suggests, instead of merely concluding what kind of attitude a text implies, it aims further to identify both the sentiment type and the target, and sometimes the attribute or aspect that the 指向. 

Generally, methods used for FSA includes lexicon-based, machine learning and deep learning 这里讲现行的方法和难点？lexicon

Data:
Financial texts can present themselves as news, reviews, corporate reports, or posts from social medias such Twitter or StockTwits (Man, Luo and Lin, 2019). 有些人自己搜集数据， FiQA, an open dataset from the WWW’18 conference,  offers about 1,1000 labeled samples for FSA training, including 435 news headlines and 675 tweets with each labeled with the target entity, aspect and a sentiment score ranging from -1 to 1 continuously (Maia et al., 2018).
